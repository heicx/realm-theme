# A Dark Theme for Mou.app

## How to Install (on OS X)

Fire up Terminal and run the following commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:zhf/realm-theme.git
$ cd realm-theme
$ ./setup.sh
```

All required files are copied to Mou by the above command, so should you want to delete the cloned repo:

```
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf realm-theme
```

**Note** The original strikethrough syntax `~~ABC~~` now renders the enclosing text as a badge.
